# heatzy-home-assistant

Climate Home Assistant component for Heatzy Pilot

## Installation

To register the heatzy component to Home Assistant, copy the `climate` folder from this repository to your Home Assistant `custom_components` folder.
The following commands assume that your Home Assistant folder is located in `~/.homeassistant/custom_components`:

```bash
# Create custom_components folder
mkdir -p ~/.homeassistant/custom_components
# Move to the custom_components folder
cd ~/.homeassistant/custom_components
# Fetch this repo and extract it
curl -L https://api.github.com/repos/Devotics/heatzy-home-hassistant/tarball/master | tar -xz
# Copy climate folder
cp -rl Devotics-heatzy-home-hassistant-*/climate .
# Clean up
rm -rf Devotics-heatzy-home-hassistant-*
```

## Usage

Once installed, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`:
```yaml
climate:
  - platform: heatzy
    username: <your heatzy email>
    password: <your heatzy password>
```
This configuration will allow the component to query the Heatzy API to retrieve and contr√¥l your devices status.
