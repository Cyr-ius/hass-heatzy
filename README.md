# Clean up
rm -rf Devotics-heatzy-home-hassistant-*
```

# Clean up

```

## Usage

Once installed, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
climate:
  - platform: heatzy
    username: <your heatzy email>
    password: <your heatzy password>
```

This configuration will allow the component to query the Heatzy API to retrieve and control your devices status.
